Reference line is a line that you can add to a visualization to indicate a specific value or range of values. Reference lines help provide context to your data by showing important thresholds, averages, or other points of interest

Right-click on the axis where you want to add the reference line.
Select "Add Reference Line..." from the context menu.
In the Reference Line dialog box, choose the type of reference line you want to add (e.g., Constant, Average, Percentile, etc.).
Configure the reference line settings, such as the value, formatting, label, etc.
Click "OK" to add the reference line to your visualization.

Trend lines show the general trend or pattern in your data. 

You can add trend lines to your visualization by right-clicking on a data series in your chart and selecting "Add Trend Line."

In Tableau, drop lines are a visual feature that helps users trace the data points on a line chart or a scatter plot back to the horizontal axis. When you hover over a data point on the line chart or scatter plot, drop lines extend from the data point down to the horizontal axis, making it easier to see the exact value of the data point and its corresponding position on the axis.

You can add drop lines to your visualization by right-clicking on a data series in your chart and selecting "Add Drop Line."
