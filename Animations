Animation:

To add animations to your visualization, you'll typically use the "Pages" shelf or the "Show Me" panel.

If you're using the Pages shelf:
Drag a dimension that represents a time-based or sequential variable (e.g., date, time, category) to the Pages shelf.
Tableau will automatically generate a series of "pages" corresponding to the unique values of the selected dimension.
Click on the "Play" button in the Pages shelf to preview the animation.
Adjust the speed and other settings of the animation as needed.
